## NOTES
- There is now a config generator and updater. config-generator.py. Usage is in the readme and docker wiki. As the name implies, you can generate new configs and update existing configs.
- If you are an existing user wanting to use the config-generator, I highly recommend to update your client names to match those set in the example-config https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/blob/5f27e01a7f179e0ea49796dcbcae206718366423/data/example-config.py#L551
- The names that match what you set as the default_torrent_client https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/blob/5f27e01a7f179e0ea49796dcbcae206718366423/data/example-config.py#L140
- This will make your experience with the config-generator much more pleasurable.
- BHD api/rss keys for BHD id/description parsing are now located with the BHD tracker settings and not within the DEFAULT settings section. It will continue to work with a notice being printed for the meantime, but please update your configs as I will permanently retire the old settings in time.
- modq for UNIT3D sites has been fixed in the UNIT3D source thanks to @AnabolicsAnonymous let me know if a site you use has updated to the latest UNIT3D source code with modq api fix, and it can be added to that sites UA file.
- You may notice that the main landing page now contains some Test Run passing displays. This does some basic checking that won't catch every error, but it may be useful for those who update directly from master branch. I'll keep adding to this over time to better catch any errors, If this display shows error, probably don't git pull.

Conversely (reminder of already existing functionality), setting met with some title  will force that episode title.

## Breaking change
* When using trackers argument,  or , you must now use a comma separated list.

## Linking support in qBitTorrent
### This is not fully tested. 
It seems to be working fine on this windows box, but you absolutely should test with the  argument to make sure it works on your system before putting it into production.
* You can specify to use symbolic or hard links
* 
* Add one or many (local) paths which you want to contain the links, and UA will map the correct drive/volume for hardlinks.

## Reminder
* UA has mkbrr support 
* You can specify an argument  or set the config 
* UA loads binary files for the supported mkbrr OS. If you find mkbrr slower than the original torf implementation when hashing torrents, the mkbrr devs are likely to be appreciative of any reports.

- two site files manually imported tmdbsimple.
- fixed R4E by adding the want tmdb data from the main tmdb api call, which negates the need to make a needless api call when uploading to R4E, and will shave around 2 seconds from the time it takes to upload.
- other site file will be fixed when I get around to dealing with that mess.

## Version 4 release notes:
## Breaking change
* When using trackers argument,  or , you must now use a comma separated list.

## Linking support in qBitTorrent
### This is not fully tested. 
It seems to be working fine on this windows box, but you absolutely should test with the  argument to make sure it works on your system before putting it into production.
* You can specify to use symbolic or hard links
* 
* Add one or many (local) paths which you want to contain the links, and UA will map the correct drive/volume for hardlinks.

## Reminder
* UA has mkbrr support 
* You can specify an argument  or set the config 
* UA loads binary files for the supported mkbrr OS. If you find mkbrr slower than the original torf implementation when hashing torrents, the mkbrr devs are likely to be appreciative of any reports.
